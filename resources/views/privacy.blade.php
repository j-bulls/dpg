QXP-US complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, the UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In certain situations, QXP-US may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
          	<p>With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to these Privacy Shield Frameworks, QXP-US is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission.</p>
          	<li><strong>EU Binding Corporate Rules – Controller</strong></li>
          	<p>QXP’s global privacy program and policies have been approved by the Dutch, Polish, Spanish, and other relevant European privacy regulators as providing adequate safeguards for the protection of privacy, fundamental rights, and freedoms of individuals for transfers of personal information protected under European law. QXP’s Binding Corporate Rules — Controller (BCR-C) — provide that transfers made by QXP worldwide of European personal information benefit from adequate safeguards.</p>

Alternatively, you can contact the data protection supervisory authority in your jurisdiction for assistance (Note, QXP’s main establishment in the EU is in the Netherlands.  As such, our EU lead authority is the Dutch Autoritiet Persoonsgegevens). </p>
          	<p>Under certain conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
          	<p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>
          	<p>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</p>
          	<p>In the last twelve months, QXP may have collected, used, and shared, for business purposes, personal information about you as described in this Privacy Statement. Each category of data may be used by QXP or shared with third parties also as described in this Privacy Statement. Residents of California have the right to request access to and deletion of the information QXP holds about them. Such requests may be submitted by clicking <a href="#">here</a> or by mail to QXP Systems, Inc., Privacy Legal Department, 170 West Tasman Dr., San Jose, CA 95134, USA. QXP will not sell your personal information without your consent.</p>
          	<p>QXP will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under CCPA. Specifically, we will not:</p>
          	<ul>
          		<li>Deny access to our Solutions;</li>
          		<li>Charge a different rate for the use of our Solutions; or</li>
          		<li>Provide a different quality of service.</li>
          	</ul>
          </ul>
          <p>California Shine the Light</p>
          <p>Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
          <p>QXP qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
          <p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third-party disclosure choices or CCPA rights</p>
